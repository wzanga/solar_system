# solar_system
A simple solar system simulation with python

nbp stands for "N-body problem". This is the main structure of the simulation.

1.It is initialized by giving it the names of the body involved in the simulation :
['SUN','MERCURY','VENUS','EARTH','MARS',............'PLUTO']

2.The initial conditions for each body must be given
By default, you should use the orbital velocities of the body w.r.t the Sun
These orbital velocities are attributes of the << body class >> (see body.py)
